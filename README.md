Chip's Tribute
==============

This project is my attempt at rebuilding Chip’s Challenge, the classic puzzle game designed by Chuck Somerville and released on Windows, Atari Lynx, Commodore 64 and… just about every other computing device in the early 90s. My goal with this project is to recreate the Windows version of Chip’s Challenge entirely in an HTML5 Canvas using a custom, from-scratch engine.
